| FR-1.2 | SA risk weight calculation for Basel 3.1 (CRE20–22), including LTV-based RE weights | P0 | Partial |

## Sovereign Exposures (CRR Art. 114)

| CQS | Rating Equivalent | Risk Weight |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | AAA to AA- | 0% |
| 2 | A+ to A- | 20% |
| 3 | BBB+ to BBB- | 50% |
| 4 | BB+ to BB- | 100% |
| 5 | B+ to B- | 100% |
| 6 | CCC+ and below | 150% |
| Unrated | — | 100% |

## Institution Exposures (CRR Art. 120-121)

!!! note "UK Deviation"
    CQS 2 institutions receive a 30% risk weight under the UK CRR, rather than the standard 50% under EU CRR.

| CQS | Risk Weight (UK) | Risk Weight (EU Standard) |
|-----|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 20% | 20% |
| 2 | **30%** | 50% |
| 3 | 50% | 50% |
| 4 | 100% | 100% |
| 5 | 100% | 100% |
| 6 | 150% | 150% |
| Unrated | 40% | 100% |

UK unrated institutions default to 40% (derived from sovereign CQS 2).

## Corporate Exposures (CRR Art. 122)

| CQS | Risk Weight |
|-----|-------------|
| 1 | 20% |
| 2 | 50% |
| 3 | 100% |
| 4 | 100% |
| 5 | 150% |
| 6 | 150% |
| Unrated | 100% |

## Retail Exposures (CRR Art. 123)

All qualifying retail exposures receive a flat **75%** risk weight.

## Residential Mortgage Exposures (CRR Art. 125)

Risk weight depends on LTV ratio with a split at 80%:

| LTV | Treatment |
|-----|-----------|
| LTV ≤ 80% | 35% on whole exposure |
| LTV > 80% | Split: 35% on portion up to 80% LTV, 75% on excess |

**Blended formula for LTV > 80%:**

```
avg_RW = 0.35 x (0.80 / LTV) + 0.75 x ((LTV - 0.80) / LTV)
```

## Commercial Real Estate (CRR Art. 126)

| Condition | Risk Weight |
|-----------|-------------|
| LTV ≤ 50% and rental income ≥ 1.5x interest costs | 50% |
| All other CRE | 100% |

## Basel 3.1 Changes

- **LTV-based residential RE weights** (CRE20.71): Risk weights vary by loan-to-value ratio — Not Started
- **Revised corporate/bank risk weights**: Updated CQS mapping — Partial
- **Removal of SME supporting factor**: No longer applicable
- **Removal of 1.06 scaling factor**: Scaling factor set to 1.0
